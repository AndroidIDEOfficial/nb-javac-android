# nb-javac-android
[nb-javac](https://github.com/oracle/nb-javac) is a patched version of OpenJDK "javac", i.e., the Java compiler. This has long been part of NetBeans, providing a highly tuned Java compiler specifically for the Java editor i.e., parsing and lexing for features such as syntax coloring, code completion.

`nb-javac-android` is a patched version of `nb-javac`. It allows developers to use `javac` i.e. the Java Compiler in android applications.

**This version of `nb-javac` is meant to be used with [`AndroidIDE`](https://github.com/itsaky/AndroidIDE). If you want to use it in your project, you might need to do some modifications. See [`Issue #1`](https://github.com/itsaky/nb-javac-android/issues/1) for more information.**
